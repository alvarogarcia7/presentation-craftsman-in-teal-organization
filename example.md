## Example Teal Orgs
  * [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com) (software)
  * [Morning star](http://morningstarco.com/) (tomato processing)
  * [Patagonia](http://eu.patagonia.com/) (outdoor clothing)

Note: Valve produces software games and related products. Produces Steam, and the store ecosystem.  Note: Morning star, not to be confused with a finance group Note: Patagonia, outdoor clothing and gear for outdoorsy people. Their purpose goes beyond producing clothing.  Note: the first one, I've deduced they have some teal practices based on their employee handbook. The rest are cited in the book:


# The Teal organization
  * Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux


## Characteristics (I)
  * Principles:
    * Wholeness
    * Self-management
    * Evolutionary purpose

Note: test 1. The organization is filled with people. What is wholeness for individuals within their organizational context?  2. The organization is an entity in itself. What is wholeness for the organization as a living system, an organism in its own right?  3. The organization occupies a position in relation to the world. What does wholeness mean in its external being – its connection with planet and society?


## Characteristics (II)
  * Metaphor: living organism

Note: other metaphors for organizations are Whereas Achievement-Orange speaks of organizations as machines and Pluralistic-Green uses the metaphor of families, Teal organizations refer to themselves as living organisms or living systems.


## Characteristics (III)
  * Small orgs
  * Staff functions



## Do craftsmen fit in a Teal organization?


## Fluid roles
  * Find time for *developer tasks* that are not **programming**:
    * Hiring
    * Analysis
    * Leadership
    * Coaching, mentoring
  * Not a punishment, but voluntary


## Decide your own career
  * Specialization or generalisation
  * On your own terms
  * Within or outside the company


## Organization size and team seniority
  * More career time
  * Less guidance
  * Leading by example
  * Swings both ways

## Development and Business partnership
  * Simpler when both are powerful
  * Fair treatment for both
  * Best company interests



# Conclusions
  * Teal might not be for you
  * With power comes responsibility
  * Recommend the book
